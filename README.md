## How To Use


## Bugs 
* When the user right clicks and also tries to draw something using the left click, he will able to draw but the MarkingMenu won't disappear. 
* When the user draws something and right clicks, his shape will be considered as done.
* The formula to match the label to the space in the MarkingMenu is not quite right, so the positions of the labels in the table were adapted to fit in.
